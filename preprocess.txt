Data Preprocessing Steps: 

1. Download genotype data in vcf file format, use plink `--make-bed` to convert vcf to bed files, split to each chromosome using `--chr`

2. Download the gene expression data and covariates data 

3. Download the GWAS Catalog gene meta informations on UCSC Genome Browser with the hg19 coordinate; generate +- 5kb cis-window for each gene

4. For each gene, expression values were normalized across samples using an inverse normal transform.

5. Standardize gene expression with mean 0 and variance 1 for each gene across individuals.

6. Compute gene expression PCs using the R package prcomp

7. Standardize genotype with mean 0 variance 1 for each SNP across individuals

8. Regress covariates out of gene expression
