# TWAS_ASSOC
Implement the eQTL analysis (first step of TWAS) in Python.

## Introduction
This project aims to employ FUSION, an advanced suite of tools for performing large-scale Transcriptome-Wide and Regulome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS and RWAS). FUSION constructs predictive models of the genetic components of functional/molecular phenotypes and tests its association with disease through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics. This implementation leverages the innovative work by [Gusev et al. (2016)] (https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3506) that integrates gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from large-scale GWAS. The objective is to identify novel associations between a GWAS phenotype, only measured in reference data, and a functional phenotype, thereby contributing to our understanding of the complex relationships between genetic variations, gene expression, and disease phenotypes.
